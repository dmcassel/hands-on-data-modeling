# Don't Leave Data As-Is - Envelope Pattern

In this unit we want to apply the the envelope pattern to the documents we denormalized in unit-01.

Sample corb command: 

java -server -cp marklogic-xcc-8.0.4.jar;corb.jar -DOPTIONS-FILE=myjob.properties com.marklogic.developer.corb.Manager

Note: We'll need to update our properties to leverage different modules for retrieving the URIs to be processed and the transformation to be applied to them.
